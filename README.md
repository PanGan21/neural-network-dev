# neural-network-dev

**neural-network-dev** is a simple companion project developed while studying _Neural Networks from Scratch_ by Harrison Kinsley and Daniel Kukieła. This repository is focused on understanding and implementing the basic building blocks of neural networks from the ground up.

## 📚 About

This project contains:

- A Python script, `neural-network.py`, that implements a basic neural network from scratch.
- Simple examples to experiment with neural networks using NumPy for numerical operations.

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6 or later**: Make sure Python is installed on your system.
- **Dependencies**: All required libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-network-dev.git
   cd neural-network-dev
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the script**:

   ```bash
   python neural-network.py
   ```

## 📓 Notes

The `neural-network.py` file contains a full implementation of a simple neural network, including layers, activation functions, and a basic loss calculation/
The code is heavily commented to explain the purpose and workings of each part, making it easy to follow and learn.
